Aviary is a soil moisture management system that runs within a Particle mesh network consisting of an Argon and n Xenons.

## Mother Bird

[Mother Bird](https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aviary/src/mother-bird/README.md) is designed to run on a [Particle](https://particle.io) [Argon](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/wi-fi/argon-datasheet/) board.  It listens to baby birds on its mesh network and manages them.  It is responsible for determining when a baby bird should water its planter box.

## Baby Bird

[Baby Bird](https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aviary/src/baby-bird/README.md) is designed to run on a [Particle](https://particle.io) [Xenon](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/mesh/xenon-datasheet/) board.  It monitors soil moisture and reports to its mother bird every 2 seconds.  It also activates an attached solenoid valve if the mother bird notifies it that it is dehydrated.

## Architecture

The system is designed to run on a mesh network with one [Mother Bird](https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aviary/src/mother-bird/README.md) and an unlimited number of [Baby Bird](https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aviary/src/baby-bird/README.md)s.  Each baby bird communicates soil moisture levels to the Mother Bird with its unique device name.  The Mother Bird then responds with that devices name and a boolean denoting whether the Baby Bird should hydrate its planter box.

## Futures

Currently, Mother Bird is simply looking for soil moisture levels below an X value.  In the future we want to add:

- [ ] On Mother Bird, check weather API to determine rain chance for the next hour.  If chance is greater than X, then delay watering for up to Y hours
- [ ] Only water between hours of 6am and 6pm
- [ ] On Baby Birds, if Mother tells us to water but our moisture level is above X, disregard her request 


### Why Aviary?

The plan had been to use [chirp.io](https://chirp.io/) to communicate between the devices giving a nice "bird chirp" throughout my backyard as the devices monitored their moisture levels and reported back to a central device.  

Since this would give a nice ambience to our backyard, we decided to name each device after a different bird.  Since each device will have a unique name we decided to name each after a different cartoon bird.

Staying within the bird theme, we decided to call our mesh netowrk Aviary.

The move to a [Particle](https://particle.io) based mesh network removed the need for using chirp.io to send data.  Instead, we will likely find some way to simply play chirp noises at random times.
